  /*
   * Why create a separate checkout() method instead of calling pay() directly:
   * - checkout() represents a higher-level business process (placing an order).
   * - pay() is just one step inside that process.
   * - This allows adding more actions later (validation, logging, stock updates,
   * etc.)
   * without changing the Payment interface or its implementations.
